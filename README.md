# Urban Sound Tagging using EfficientNet
The purpose of this project is to investigate how urban audio samples in computer-readable
forms might be classified into the appropriate classes using an image transfer learning
model. As a baseline, the EfficientNet-B1 model is used, along with Log-mel Spectrogram feature representations. To improve
the baseline results,various audio data augmentation techniques are investigated.
the two notebooks available are for the ESC-50/ESC-10 dataset and the UrbanSound8k dataset.
